Unweighted isn’t just code; it’s a manifesto for seeing what others miss. This repository holds the tools, algorithms, and frameworks that redefine communication analysis. It doesn’t stop at tracking calls or mapping conversations—it goes deeper, uncovering patterns, predicting outcomes, and revealing the truths hidden in the shadows. Every interaction leaves a trace, and Unweighted turns that trace into clarity.

Call tracking has been reimagined here. Unweighted deciphers not just what’s said, but what’s left unsaid. It maps the pauses, the silences, and the intent, transforming raw data into sharp, actionable insights. It doesn’t just follow a trail—it predicts the next move, staying steps ahead of what others can see.

This is the power of data unleashed. Communication isn’t random, and Unweighted knows it. It works tirelessly in real time, ensuring no signal is lost, no detail overlooked. Data doesn’t sleep, and neither does Unweighted. It’s always listening, learning, and adapting.

Unweighted is a vision for the future of communication analytics. Whether you’re here to explore its depths, contribute to its growth, or simply witness what it already understands, you’re stepping into a world where nothing escapes the algorithmic eye. Can you keep up?
